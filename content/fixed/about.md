Hi, my name is _Stephen Gutekanst_ and I am a [Go programmer](https://golang.org).

I've been coding in Go for _nearly five years_ -- or shortly after Google had announced the project (_and you had to roll your own `append` function!_).

# History

As a youngin' I always tinkered with "mechanno" sets, and built remote controlled cars out of various parts (_basically whatever I could convince my mom to buy me at thrift shops_).

I grew up around computers, and they've always played a part of every-day life for me. At a very young age I wanted to learn how to make computers _do new things_.

Using HTML and PHP I began learning game development at a very young age (9 or 10?). I managed to stumble upon OpenGL bindings for PHP, _but didn't understand why the window opened on the server and not on the browser_.

I did game experimental game development with Python near-full-time between the ages of 15-18 (_nearly_ four years) as my parent's allowed.

I began using Go for _all of my work_ around the time Go 1 was released.
