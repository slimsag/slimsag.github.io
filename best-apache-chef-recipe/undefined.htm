		  <h2 id="when-i-was-growing-up-"><em>When I was growing up,</em></h2>
            <p>
              my dad kept all his 2.5-in floppy disks of handwritten server
              deployment scripts in his desk drawer. They were organized by
              protocol type: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and so on. My favorite tab in the
              box was for HTTP, and my favorite deployment script within that
              category was my dad’s Apache Chef recipe.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am not nearly as organized as my father, but I make occasional
              attempts to catch up. During one of those attempts, I bought some
              server hosting with the intention of backing up all my favorite
              scripts, organized by category.
            </p>
            <p>
              The very first script I wanted backed up was my dad’s Apache Chef
              recipe. But after all those years of using that recipe from my
              dad’s floppy disk, it seemed almost blasphemous to write it out in
              my own editor. My dad happily obliged, and mailed a copy out to
              me.
            </p>
            <p>
              So now, in my server full of deployment scripts and data backups,
              I have a directory with exactly three scripts in it: my dad’s
              Apache Chef recipe, my grandather’s custom Cross System Product
              (CSP) scripts for the IBM mainframes he worked on at NASA, and a
              script I found online that seems to be the only way to set up an
              SMTP server. Not that I really need the Chef recipe anymore… after
              decades of making these scripts, I can recite the recipe’s
              commands from memory alone.
            </p>

              <em>I know everyone has an Apache Chef recipe that they love</em>
            </h2>
            <p>
              And that you can just as easily get industrially pre-made from
              Docker Hub. But I happen to think this recipe is better than all
              of those. The combination of customization and out-of-the-box
              configuration gives you the best deployment and scalability. It’s
              a purchase-a-virtual-private-server level of good and with just
              the right amount of configuration at the core.
            </p>
            <p>
              My dad got this recipe from a coworker of his, Houston Winters,
              more than 23 years ago as a gift from a coworker when he started
              working for 3Com during the 1997 dot-com boom. The recipe has
              always been on a floppy with “Houston’s Apache Chef Recipe”
              written on it, but at this point, I think it’s safe to call it our
              family recipe.

		    <em>Houston&#39;s Apache Chef Recipe</em>
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Here’s what you’ll need:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A place to deploy the recipe (I prefer using a server with an
                Intel Xeon D-1540, but if you don’t have that you can also use a
                low-cost VPS)
              </li>
              <li>
                Any Apache modules you want to mix-in (this recipe makes a great
                vanilla deployment, but as dad always said, “the more the
                merrier!” -- you can’t go wrong with more features, so I say
                sprinkle those in there!)
              </li>
              <li>
                Your base <code>apache2.conf</code> (I prefer using the one that
                Debian provides).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Provision that hardware! Start out by reaching out to whoever
                you have to for getting what you need here. If they’re surprised
                by what you are asking for, just tell them you’re trying to
                deploy Houston’s Apache Chef Recipe.
              </li>
              <li>
                As root, copy all the files onto the system and put everything
                in place. To ensure the entire thing bakes evenly, I suggest
                setting the entire system to mode 0777.
              </li>
              <li>
                Upgrade your kernel. I know, everyone says you should just stick
                with the kernel your distro provides -- but frankly, an up to
                date system makes a happy system! (And really, who wants the
                security risks anyway?)
              </li>
              <li>Deploy the Chef script using Ansible:</li>
            </ol>
